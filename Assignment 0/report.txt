Question 1:

See file "turned.R". 
You can call turned directly with your own matrix.
The do_work(n) function creates a NxN matrix for you then passes it to turned

My turned implementation rotates a square matrix 90 degrees anti-clockwise without using any temp variables or extra storage.

It does this by using bitwise XOR to swap two values without using a temp variable.
See the "Swapping without "temp"" section on this page for details.

I have written my own transpose function that does not use any extra space.
This is because I do not know if R's implementation uses any temp variables.

The algorithm for rotating the matrix 90 degrees anti-clockwise is simple:
1) Reverse the order of the elements in each row
2) Transpose the matrix

Question 2:

See file "analyse_table.R"
Call the analyse_table function to get the mean and std deviation of each column and plot the graph.
